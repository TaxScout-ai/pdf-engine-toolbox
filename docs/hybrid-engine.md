# The hybrid engine: lite + PaddleOCR + VL 1.6

Written down because this decision has now been re-derived twice from scratch
after a context loss, and the second time it was re-derived *wrongly* — VL was
reported as a dead end when the measurement said something narrower. Everything
below is measured, not recalled. If you are picking this up cold, you do not
need to re-run any of it.

## The shape

Three components, because no single one does all three jobs.

| | job | why not the others |
|---|---|---|
| **pdf-engine-lite** (1.08 GB) | text extraction, page ops | serves the 81% that never need recognition; too small to hold a recogniser |
| **PaddleOCR** (full image) | word-level geometry | the only one that emits per-word boxes |
| **PaddleOCR-VL 1.6** | accurate reading of hard scans | reads digits the standard OCR gets wrong |

## Why VL cannot simply replace PaddleOCR

VL emits **no word-level geometry**, in either mode. Probed both ways
(`vl-probe/probe.py`): `layout_det_res` and `use_ocr_for_image_block: true`.
Blocks only.

Three shipped features are built on per-word boxes:

- the split-screen viewer highlighting where a field sits on the page
- the searchable PDF a CPA selects text in
- the page coordinates evidence is anchored to

So PaddleOCR stays. That is the whole finding — it is a reason for a hybrid, not
a reason to drop VL.

## Why VL is worth having anyway

It reads things the standard recogniser does not. Measured: on the drivers-
licence case VL returns `3497` where PaddleOCR returns `349` — a dropped digit
in a street number, and the same class of defect as the misreads that reach
CPAs as corrections.

Cost: **25.1 s/page** on this CPU.

> The figure **933 s/doc** appears in older notes. It is **withdrawn**: it was
> measured while VL was failing at import, so it timed a crash, not a model.
> Do not use it to argue against VL.

## What it took to run VL on this machine

The published weights are bfloat16 and this CPU has no AVX512-BF16, so the model
aborts on load. Converting the 620 tensors to fp32 fixes it; the converted
weights live in `PaddleOCR-VL-1.6-fp32`. This is not a memory problem — the
machine has 61 GB and that was a wrong diagnosis made once already.

## Do not bump paddlepaddle

`requirements.txt` pins `paddlepaddle>=3.2.0,<3.3.0` and the comment saying why
is load-bearing. 3.3.1 breaks CPU OCR via an oneDNN regression, and it breaks it
*silently*: a scan returns an empty result reported as success. Measured on a
real document — 3.2.2 returns 21 words, 3.3.1 returns none and says it worked.

The unit tests do **not** catch this. There are no PDF fixtures, so all 82 pass
against a broken engine. This bump was made once and reverted.

## Routing

- text layer present (81%) → lite, no recognition at all
- scan needing geometry → PaddleOCR
- scan where the read is doubted, or a field fails corroboration → VL

The lite image needs no code change to be safe: every paddle import is lazy,
inside the function that needs it (`pdf_service.py:314, 1350, 2151`). It answers
`/info` and `/text/extract` normally and fails an OCR request with a clear
message rather than crashing.

What lite cannot serve, and must route to the full image:

    /text/ocr                          needs Paddle
    /text/tables?strategy=ppstructure  needs Paddle  (strategy=pymupdf works)
    /transform/deskew                  needs Paddle
    /convert/from-office               needs LibreOffice

## Corpus facts

582 files, of which 20 are not PDFs at all — base64, JavaScript and raw binary
carrying a `.pdf` extension. 447 of the rest carry a usable text layer; 82 are
genuine scans. Deduplicated by content hash the corpus is 324 documents.

PyMuPDF beats pdf-inspector on this corpus, 475/15 against 451/26, which is why
pdf-inspector is not in the stack.

## State as of 2026-08-04

Done:

- PyMuPDF 1.28.0, A/B on six documents byte-identical
- paddlepaddle bump reverted
- lite image built and verified, 3.92 GB → 1.08 GB

Not done:

- **VL is not a service.** No code, no dependency, no Dockerfile entry in this
  repo. It exists only as `vl-probe/probe.py` plus converted weights.
- Nothing here is deployed. Dev runs an image built 2026-07-28; the three
  commits above sit on a local branch with no upstream.
